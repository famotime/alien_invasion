# High Score Persistence Feature for Alien Invasion

## Core Concept

The High Score Persistence feature is designed to save players' highest achieved scores, ensuring that these scores are retained even after the game is closed and reopened. This allows players to track their best performances over time and strive to surpass their previous records or compete with others who might play on the same system.

## Implementation Ideas

Here's how the High Score Persistence feature could be implemented:

*   **Local Score Storage:**
    *   Scores would be saved locally on the player's computer in a designated file.
    *   **File Formats:** Several formats could be used:
        *   **JSON:** A human-readable and easy-to-parse format. Each entry could be an object with "name" (or "initials") and "score" fields.
        *   **CSV (Comma Separated Values):** A simple text-based format where each line represents a score, e.g., "PlayerName,Score".
        *   **Plain Text:** A basic text file, perhaps with each score on a new line, potentially with a name/initials prefix.
    *   The game would read this file upon startup to load existing high scores and update it whenever a new high score is achieved.

*   **Displaying High Scores:**
    *   A list of the top N scores (e.g., Top 5 or Top 10) would be displayed within the game.
    *   **Location:** This could be:
        *   On the game's start screen/main menu.
        *   On a dedicated "High Scores" screen accessible from the main menu.
        *   Displayed briefly at the end of a game session, especially if the player achieved a new high score.

*   **Player Identification:**
    *   When a player achieves a score that qualifies for the high score list, they should be prompted to enter their initials (e.g., 3 characters) or a short name.
    *   This personalizes the high score list and allows players to easily identify their own achievements.

## Gameplay Enhancement

The High Score Persistence feature would significantly enhance the Alien Invasion gameplay experience in the following ways:

*   **Increased Replayability:**
    *   It provides a strong long-term goal for players. Instead of just playing for the immediate thrill, players are motivated to return to the game to try and beat their own previous best scores or climb higher on the leaderboard.

*   **Sense of Achievement and Competition:**
    *   Seeing their name or initials on the high score list gives players a tangible sense of accomplishment.
    *   Even when playing solo, it fosters a sense of competition against oneself. If multiple people use the same computer, it can lead to friendly local competition.

*   **Tracking Improvement:**
    *   Players can see how their skills are improving over time by observing their high scores increase. This positive feedback loop can be very motivating.

*   **Benchmarking Performance:**
    *   High scores serve as a benchmark. Players can compare their current run's performance against the established high scores, adding another layer of self-assessment during gameplay.

*   **Extends Game Lifespan:**
    *   By providing a persistent record of achievements, the game remains relevant and engaging for a longer period, as players will always have a target to aim for.

In summary, High Score Persistence is a fundamental feature for arcade-style games like Alien Invasion, as it adds lasting value, encourages repeated play, and gives players a clear measure of their mastery over the game.
